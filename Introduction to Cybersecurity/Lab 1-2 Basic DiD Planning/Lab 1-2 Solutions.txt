Lab 1-2 | Basic DiD Planning

Lab Task: Defense in Depth Planning(See PDF for image references)

1. Match each security control option below with its suitable numbered position in the structure above:
	A. Firewall - 6
	B. Fence - 1
	C. Authentication - 4
	D. Door - 3
	E. CCTV - 2
	F. Intrusion prevention system (IPS) - 5


2. Provide a basic explanation of the Defense in Depth concept.
	The term "DiD" describes a distributed, multi-layered security control mechanism used across an entire IT system.


3. Why is it important to have multiple layers of defense?
	A robust defense system for an organization must consist of multiple layers. Adding more layers keeps organizational assets safer
	and makes illegal access more challenging.


4. Translate the castleâ€™s defense mechanisms to cybersecurity-related defenses.
	-The moat and the walls represent a firewall. 
	- The door represents an entrance that prevents physical access.
	- The person with binoculars represents a CCTV system. 
	- The knights represent an antivirus application. 
	- The archer represents an intrusion prevention system (IPS).
