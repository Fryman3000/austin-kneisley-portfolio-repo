Lab 3-2 IP Addressing

Lab Task: IP Addressing Quiz

1. PC1 has the IP address 10.0.25.29, and tries to communicate with PC2, which has the IP address 192.168.1.12.
Assume that both PCs are on the same LAN and are not connected to a router. Will PC1â€™s communication attempt
succeed if the addresses follow the A, B, C network class system? Why or why not?
	-No, They cannot connect on the same LAN since their subnets are different.


2. PC5 has the IP 172.20.7.12. What is its subnet mask and CIDR, according to network addressing?
	- /16 or 255.255.0.0, the default subnet mask for this IP range.


3. PC3 has the IP 172.20.0.13 and wants to communicate with PC5, which has the IP 172.20.7.12.
Both PCs are not connected to a router. Can PC3 communicate with PC5 if the addresses follow the 
classful network addressing model? Why?
	- Yes. They share the same network, 172.20.0.0/16, and have the same subnets by default.


4. PC6 has the IP address 10.0.0.25. Can packets be routed directly to PC6 from the internet and vice versa? Why?
	- No, 10.0.0.25 would not function on the internet because it is a private address (RFC 1918).


5. List two public IP addresses.
	-8.8.8.8
	-192.104.248.0


6. Which class does the network address 172.16.0.0 belong to?
	-Class B


7. What are the network and host portions of the address 192.168.0.54/24?
	-192.168.0 > Network portion
	-.54 > Host portion
